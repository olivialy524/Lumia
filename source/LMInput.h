/**
 * This class represents player input in the Platform demo.
 *
 * This input handler uses the CUGL input API.  It uses the polling API for
 * keyboard, but the callback API for touch.  This demonstrates a mix of ways
 * to handle input, and the reason for hiding it behind an abstraction like
 * this class.
 *
 * In the case of touch devices, this implements the platformer controls
 * found in the popular game Oddmar.  The left side is a floating joystick
 * for left-right controls.  The right side is swipe up to jump and double
 * tap to shoot.
 *
 * Unlike CUGL input devices, this class is not a singleton.  It must be
 * allocated before use.  However, you will notice that we do not do any
 * input initialization in the constructor.  This allows us to allocate this
 * controller as a field without using pointers. We simply add the class to the
 * header file of its owner, and delay initialization (via the method init())
 * until later. This is one of the main reasons we like to avoid initialization
 * in the constructor.
